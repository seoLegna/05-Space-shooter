Project: Space shooter peer review
Peer's repository: 
https://github.com/seoLegna/05-Space-Shooter.git


What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I still have a lot to learn because I could not figure out how to fix the type error. Additionally, I realized how important organization is to understanding the code and being able to fix things. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I was unable to run the game so I couldn't really get a feel for their interpretation of the product, but I liked that their code was simplified in the sense where I didn't have to hunt to know what was going on which is something I need to improve on.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Try using classes to seperate the different aliens. This way you can put all of the attributes in one area and make the setup cleaner. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I don't have any comments for this part. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nothing in the code itself was confusing. The errors were, however.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Game play instructions or objectives would be a good idea. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I really liked the sprites you chose and the code was clear enough to me. I'm not sure why I got such odd errors when I tried to run it. It wasn't recognizing some integer and it didn't want to initialize your sprites. BUT it looked like it would've been fun :)
